* Overview

Program to play arbitrary waveforms on an Arduino.

The Arduino needs to have sufficient flash memory, the program was
tested on an ArduinoMega2560 (Atmega2560).

* Instructions

Add your data as comma separated C array construction lists, see the
examples in the =data/= directory.

* Known issues

- Increasing the amount of data further will decrease the speed of the
  PWM, the explicit speed setting seems to be ignored.
